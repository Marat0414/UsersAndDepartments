# UsersAndDepartments
CRUD operations with users and their departments &amp; vice versa

The interrelation of two entities - users and departments is shown. You can find, remove, add or update users. 
Similar operations can be performed with departments.
You cannot delete a department while it has at least one user.
When adding a new or updating the data of an existing employee, it is enough to specify only the name of his department
The relationship between user and department classes is many to one.
For convenience - when displaying information of the selected department - only the names and surnames of users who work in this department are displayed, 
and not all information on them.
